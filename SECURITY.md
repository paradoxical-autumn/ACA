# Security Policy

We define any security related issues as issues that allow for access to certain components and types that should be moderated, such as `SimpleAvatarProtection` as that can allow for avatar ripping or any of the permissions components as those control the world itself.

...or anything else that's security related.

If you believe you have found a security issue, please report it here on the security tab as creating a public issue is not advised as it allows bad actors to abuse the bug while it is still present.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the security tab of the GitHub repo to report the vulnerability. You can expect a response within a day.

You do not gain anything except credits in the patch notes for finding and reporting a vulnerability. You do not loose anything by having a report declined.

**Please do not be scared to open security tickets if you're unsure.** We don't mind having to explain why we *don't* think something is an issue and it's better to be safe than sorry.

## Step-By-Step guide to reporting an issue about component types
For any different types of security issues, please actually run through the process properly!

### Severity
Feel free to use the calculator or define your own severity. All issues are triaged and adjusted accordingly but setting an accurate severity can speed this up.

### Weaknesses
Feel free to ignore this section but fill it out if you know how to as it'll help speed things up by telling us exactly what's gone wrong.
