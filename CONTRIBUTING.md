# Contributing Guidelines

**Failure to follow these guidelines can result in action from a simple warning to a permanent ban.**

## General
- Be respectful.
  - This should be a given but remember that everyone here is a living creature with their own thoughts & feelings on the other side of your screen.

- Be direct
  - Imagine you have 30 seconds to explain your problem/solution, if we need to read long paragraphs of text to understand then it's likely that processing your contribution will take longer.

- Be specific

- Upvote issues/PRs! Don't bump them.
  - To upvote an issue, react to the original post with a thumbs up emoji (üëç)
    - This is as when looking for important issues, we often sort by this reaction to easily find what the community thinks is important
  - Bumping these creates excess noise in the activity and feedback of an issue and doesn't rank it higher when we sort by upvotes
  - Similarly, stating that an issue still exists on the latest build isn't helpful - if we haven't stated that the issue or PR has been addressed, it's not necessary to write a message about its existence.
  - TL;DR: Upvote issues. Don't just say "bump" in the comments.

## Issues
- Check if an issue already exists before creating a new one
  - If an issue already exists, add any additional info there to prevent us from closing your issue as a duplicate and then ignoring it in the future.

- Make separate issues for unrelated features/bugs
  - Please break up your issues into smaller issues if needed.
  - Don't report 4 bugs as one issue as that can clog up our bug tracker.
  - Doing this signals to us that we need to solve all issues at once rather then tackling them one at a time meaning it'll take longer to process

- Fill out all the information you have
  - Do not create "blank" or "placeholder" issues as these will most likely be ignored
  - All issues create a notification for us on the management side and we often check it immediately.
  - Seeing an issue that's not ready means we will probably accidentally ignore it once it *is* finished.

## Pull Requests
- Make separate PRs for unrelated features.
  - Akin to "Make separate issues"
  - Example: if you are adding in items relating to an audio engine and items relating to ACA, don't submit both in the same PR.
  - These aren't related and just waste our time as now we need to verify both parts of your PR work which can take longer than if these were just seperate PRs.

- Ensure you give commits proper messages
  - This just helps us speed up recognising what was changed at a glance.
  - Akin to "fill out the information you have" above
