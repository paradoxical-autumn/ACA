# ArbitraryComponentAccess
A powerful resonite plugin designed to give you Arbitrary Component Access.

It adds ProtoFlux nodes designed to:
- Get components from slots
- Get fields from components
- Convert IFields into objects (ref hacking) *(to be completed)*

# Warning!! // STOP!!
Do ***NOT*** use this plugin if:
- You do not know what you are doing
- You plan to play with people you do *not* trust
- You were asked to install this for no valid reason.

ACA gives *anyone* (in your session) complete access to any and all creations spawned in a world, therefore you must only use it with people you __trust__.
One such example of a risk, is that avatar protections can be **_ENTIRELY_** removed without consent!

Paradoxical Autumn and other contributors do not take liability for any misusage of this plugin or any damage caused from usage of the plugin.
