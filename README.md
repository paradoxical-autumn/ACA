# Arbitrarily Contained Anarchy
*(formerlly Arbitrary Componetn Access)*
A powerful resonite **plugin** (not a mod, [see below](#isnt-this-dangerous-for-other-people-who-dont-have-it-installed)) designed to impliment some more *dangerous* functionality into FrooxEngine. Originally starting as a simple plugin to give you Arbitrary Component Access it has since evolved into much more.

# FAQ
## Isn't this dangerous for other people who don't have it installed??
Nope! This isn't a mod. You can't just join a random session and start [ab]using the plugin. You can only use it in sessions where the host has explicitly installed it as well.

## My [thing] from an older version disconnected a bunch of wires/became a `MissingComponent`?
That's probably a bug from when we were recreating namespaces. Check if there's a more recent version of the plugin and if not, report it as a bug. Make sure to clarify what fields are broken and on what components. Also, if you know what version you saved the item on that can also help!

## Why did you make this?
We got bored.
